C# Assignment 1

3.1 Requirements Part 1 – Pass Grade (C)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.1.1 Write a class with the name Pet and three fields (instance variables): name
(string), age (int) and isFemale (bool). Save the class as pet.cs on your hard
disk

3.1.2 All of the three fields should be declared as private.

3.1.3 Write at least two methods in the Pet class, one for reading user input (the
above three values) and one that displays the pet information as in the previous
figure.

3.1.4 Write a start class “PetOwnerMain” and save it as petownermain.cs in the
same directory as the pet.cs file.

3.1.5 Write a Main method, create an object of Pet and call the methods of the object
to get an output as shown in the run example.

3.1.6 Control of user input is not mandatory in this assignment. Expect that users
provide valid values.

4. Part 2 - Program your own object - – only for A and B Grades

4.1 For the object that you have chosen, include at least three fields that describe the
objects of this type best. Determine a data type (string, int, double etc.) that each
attribute can be represented by.
As an example, for album objects, you can create a class named Album in which the
name of the singer, number of tracks, and release date could be some good fields.
These can be declared as string, int and DateTime, respectively. Think about at least
two operations (methods) that can be performed on the object using its fields.
The object does not have to be a physical thing; it may be a conceptual object, a
calculation object, or an object like “Recipe”, “Math”, or Address. For an Address class,
street, city, and zip code are good attributes for most purposes. All of these three
attributes can be declared as string, as they all contain a sequence of characters (even
the zip code, which is not a number).

4.2 Create a new Project in the same Solution as Part I, or create a new Solution in VS for
this project. Follow the same pattern as in Part 1 to solve the problem:
Programming in C# I Assignment 1

4.2.1 You must create two methods as in Part I.

4.2.2 All instance variables must be declared as private. No variable should be
declared public.
